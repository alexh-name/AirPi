        Output data in the format stipulated by the plugin. Calibration is

        Note this method takes account of the different data formats for
        'standard' sensors as distinct from the GPS. The former present a dict
        containing one value and associated properties such as units and
        symbols, while the latter presents a dict containing several readings
        such as latitude, longitude and altitude, but no units or symbols.
        Because this particular plugin (xively) does not show time, the
        third argument (normally called 'sampletime') is called 'dummy'
        to facilitate compliance with pylint.
